# vSLAM-Con

This is the repository for the paper [Enhanced Visual SLAM for Construction Robots by Efficient Integration of Dynamic Object Segmentation and Scene Semantics] (in-press).

vSLAM-Con is an enhanced visual SLAM framework tailored to address the unique dynamic challenges commonly found in construction environments. More specifically, vSLAM-Con adopts an unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS)-based pipeline to capture a diverse range of dynamic objects, including those that are not seen in pre-defined classes in common public datasets.
